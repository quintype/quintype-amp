Therefore, in explaining the<em> </em>statements in the balance sheets, the directors' report must be taken together to find out the true meaning and<em> </em>purport of the statements.<em> </em></p><p>In such a scenario, the Delhi High Court speaking through Justice <strong>AK Sikri</strong> (as he then was) in <em><a href=\\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/617032/\\">Sheetal Fabrics v. Coir Cushions Ltd</a>,</em> laid down that a statement in the balance sheet indicating liability is to be read along with the directors' report to see whether both so read would amount to an acknowledgement.</p>",

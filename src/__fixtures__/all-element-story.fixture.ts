That day, local news outlets reported that the <ins><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/coronavirus">coronavirus</a></ins> had arrived on Rikers: an incarcerated person and a correction officer who worked at a security gate near the island’s entrance had both tested positive for <em>covid</em>-19. There are about fifty-four hundred people in the city’s jails, and more than nine hundred of them are fifty and older, according to the Board of Correction. Most have not been convicted of the charges against them; they are waiting for their cases to move through the courts.</p>'

When we spoke on the phone that afternoon, she sometimes had to pause because, she said, “I’m a little short of breath.” That day, de Blasio announced plans to release forty people from the jail system in light of the coronavirus outbreak, a number that Bedard and advocates say is not sufficient.

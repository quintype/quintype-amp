The purpose of the AMP library is to ease creation of AMP pages by providing ready-to-use customizable components, using which you can build custom templates, or use the default templates that the library provides. The default templates too have a several customization options.

#### AMP Story Pages

In case of AMP story pages, we will be supporting all the major Quintype story templates (text, video, photo, live-blog).

If you wish to make your own templates, you can do so and pass it to the amp library via `opts` object in the `ampifyStory` helper function (more on that later).

You can also mix and match i.e. say use your custom template just for live-blog stories and use the default templates for everything else

<em><b>However, please note that at the time of writing this, the amp library is providing only the generic template that's rendered for all story types. You may write custom templates for other types of stories if you wish to do so.</b></em>

You may go to the next part of the tutorial which explains the {@tutorial default-story-templates} and their customization options.

Or, if you want to build your custom templates, you may go to {@tutorial custom-story-templates}

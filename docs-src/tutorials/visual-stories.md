AMP [Visual Stories](https://amp.dev/about/stories/) consist of `pages`. These are in turn made up of `layers` containing basic amp `elements`. Read [this](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/start/visual_story/parts_of_story/?format=stories) for more info.

- Firstly, make sure visual stories are enabled. Please talk to support for this
- The first visual story page shows the hero image, headline, author name and publisher logo.
- Every subsequent visual story page corresponds to a Quintype story card (i.e. the second visual story page will show the 1st storycard)
- Only the following story elements are supported - image, title, also-read, answer, bigfact, blockquote, blurb, q-and-a, question, quote, summary, title, normal paragraph (text). All other story elements are ignored
- At this point of time our CMS does not support uploading videos, so they're not supported by AmpLib
- At the end, a [bookend](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-story-bookend/?format=stories) (which is an end screen of an AMP story, showcasing sharing and related content) is shown.

#### The default visual story template:

Visual stories are rendered using this default template if no other template is chosen. More templates are WIP. It has the following features:

- There can be only one image per story card. If more than one image is added (per card), the first one is displayed
- Similarly, there can be only one `title` story element
- there can be one or more (or a combination of)Â also-read, answer, bigfact, blockquote, blurb, q-and-a, question, quote, summary, title, normal paragraph story elements. They're positioned at the bottom of the visual story page

#### Visual story specific feature configs

```js
dummyOpts = {
  featureConfig: {
    visualStories: {
      autoAdvanceAfter: "5s",
      bookendUrl: "/foo.json",
      ads: {
        doubleclick: {
          dataSlot: "/1009127/FOO_AMP_TOP"
        }
      }
    }
  }
};
```

1. `autoAdvanceAfter`: (String) sets the time after which the page automatically advances. If omitted, the page will not automatically advance. Example: "500ms", "3s"
2. `bookendUrl`: (String) the endpoint called by the bookend component. Please make sure that the route exists in your app and that it returns data in a valid format. `storyId` and `sectionId` are passed as query parameters. Refer [docs](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-story-bookend/?format=stories)
3. ad slot: (String) example "/1009443/PUBLISHER_AMP_TOP" `featureConfig` > `visualStories` > `ads` > `doubleclick` > `dataSlot` sets the ad slot for visual stories. Ads are dynamically inserted, please read [docs](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-story-auto-ads/?format=stories)
